Additionally, the Python files have been converted to a single executable by PyInstaller.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  These executables WILL NOT operate on any smartphone or tablet device.  See the discussion below for smartphone and tablet executables.

After downloading, extract the file into your home directory (required) using the command line: "tar xvfz [FILENAME.tgz]"

This command is bundled with Linux (including Raspberry Pi OS), MacOS and Windows systems and will function as shown for all these systems.

To further improve runtime setup prior to running, the following environment vairables.  This variables should be defined with the user's ".bashrc" or ".bash_profile" files:
IMPORTANT UPDATE: The variables list below MUST BE configured or the call sign lookup menu option will not function properly.

On Linux and MacOS systems define these varaibles in your user .bashrc or .bash_profiles files:

export $HOME=PATH TO YOUR HOME DIRECTORY ...... If it's not already defined but typically it is

export OAS_CALLSIGN="YOUR CALL SIGN"

export OAS_FIRSTNAME="FIRST NAME"

export OAS_LASTNAME="LAST NAME"

export OAS_STATUS="Station Operator"

export OAS_NOTES="TBD"

export QRZ_USER="YOUR CALL SIGN"

export QRZ_PASSWORD="YOUR QRZ.COM PASSWORD"

Open the classic Control Panel.
Navigate to Control Panel\User Accounts\User Accounts.
On the left, click on the Change my environment variables link.

On Windows run the "Edit the system environment variables" GUI and follow these steps.  
1. Open the classic Control Panel.
2. Navigate to Control Panel\User Accounts\User Accounts.
3. On the left, click on the Change my environment variables link.
4.  Select the "Environment Variables" button
5.  Under the "User variables for USERNAME" select the "New" button
6.  Create a new variable for:  OAS_CALLSIGN, OAS_FIRSTNAME, OAS_LASTNAME, OAS_STATUS, QRZ_USER, and QRZ_PASSWORD as show for the UNIX systems above.

or from the command prompt:
1. Open a new command prompt
2. Type the following command: setx <variable_name> "<variable_value>"
3. Substitute <variable_name> with the actual name of the variable you want to create.
4. Substitute "<variable_value>" with the value you want to assign to your variable.

If you do not have a QRZ.COM subscription account, the above configuration is not required.  However, Net Scraper uses QRZ.COM for call sign lookup, therefore, this feature will not function.
